Over the past few months I’ve been quietly working on building the new website for the company I work at, Seenit, and today it goes live! As a company we’ve worked with some incredible customers across 1000s of remarkable projects and we wanted to create a website that would allow us to share these stories.

#### Design 🎨

Using a _mobile first_ approach, I opted to completely redesign the site inline with the evolving company brand and the Seenit story at its core. Aesthetically, we wanted to keep the design fresh, simple, and clean. I wanted to completely stay away from using a template and instead create an original design.

<div class="container">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-12"> 
<div align="center">
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/blog/new-website-22-05-2018.jpg" alt="new seenit website">
</div>
</div>

</div>

#### Build 🖥

Speed and security were a priority and thus I opted to use a static site generator called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the site. In their words, this meant trading in the days of databases, comment moderation and pesky updates for a super fast site that the company can easily manage over time. Building the site in this way also meant we could move away from using a ubiquitous web template and instead, put our own  mark on the site and give it much more of a Seenit vibe. We are using a static site content management system called [CloudCannon](https://cloudcannon.com/) that enables the team to update any part of the site visually without ever having to touch the code. 🔥

#### What do ya think? ❓

It's been amazing to work on a project like this in my spare time and I've learned a huge amount along the way. We’re planning to update the site with loads of cool stuff and more stories over the coming months, but if you have any feedback or like the sound of what Seenit does, drop them a line!
