### Since starting in November 2016, a group of eight people in their spare time built Tusk, a task site with the ambition of empowering students to work around studies, choosing the work they wanted to do.

Simply put, Tusk is a platform that allows anyone to list a task where a task can be anything. Students in the local area can apply and complete the tasks, earning money whilst not having to commit to full time work.

We have so far trialled in Winchester and Oxford in order to collect feedback and iterate the product. We are now ready. September the 25th. London, we're coming for ya.

Checkout [Tusk](https://tusktasks.io) to find out more.
