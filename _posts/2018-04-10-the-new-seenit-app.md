#### Over the last 6 months I've has the pleasure of working with an amazing team to help release the new Seenit Capture 2.0.

As part of the release, we wanted to put together a short video showcasing the new features on offer. It was time to get back into my of my favourite programmes, Adobe's After Effects. Using some basic 2D animation and funky backing track, we were able to get across the new release in, what we felt was, a far more engage manner.

Seenit Capture 2.0 is available to download for free on the App Store and Google Play. Check out it and see what you think! You can use the project id: `seenitcommunity` to be part of a Seenit project, giving you the opportunity to shape the story alongside fellow fans, peers, and friends.
