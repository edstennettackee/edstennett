Hello, world. This is my first ever blog post, a weirdly daunting concept that’s a living, breathing example that some New Years resolutions do come to fruition, at least in part. The idea was that over 2018, I want to learn and I find the best way to learn is to talk and explain what you’ve learned, to teach someone else. A blog seemed like the perfect medium to facilitate this so I got to work designing a site and building a static blog with Jekyll. Having set up blogs previous with Wordpress, it wasn’t entirely unfamiliar territory, though still something new to try and an opportunity to learn some more front end skills, particularly around building static sites and Shopify’s amazing liquid syntax.

Fast forward a couple of months and here I sit in my London flat, writing my first ever blog post.

I hope that a blog will help me massively to broaden and improve my skill set. We’ll see.
