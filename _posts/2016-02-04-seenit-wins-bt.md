Since November, when we applied for BT Infinity Lab competition among digital innovators, we kept our fingers crossed. Today we are excited to announce: we won! Now our idea to embed viewers’ reaction to live coverage of events could be used by such a popular channel as BT Sport.

We were seven finalists in the end. One of the judges was BT Sport presenter Jake Humphrey, and he liked our app.

> _“I loved the pitch from SeenIt. User Generated Content is not a fad, or a short-lived trend, it’s an integral part of broadcasting live events in the future, and this relationship with BT Sport really does put the viewers at the heart of our content. I’m really excited about it.”_

Other judges also liked the whole idea of putting the fans’ at the core of live broadcasting and the way we implemented it.

We can’t wait to work with BT’s research and innovative team to make more beautiful things, and we just love our new beautiful award. For six months, they will create content using our app.
