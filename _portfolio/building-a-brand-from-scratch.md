## TL:DR;

uWork (latterly Tusk) was the biggest personal project I have taken on. As a start up with big aspirations, it gave me invaluable experience working with other designers and developers. Working in my spare evenings and weekends, I was responsible for creating and maintaining the brand, UI and UX design, and print design for the company.

## Background

uWork was born in Oxford by a group of students short of money and looking for a way to use some of their skills to earn money. I knew one of the people involved when the initial team was being assembled and was invited to join the first team kick off meeting of 5 people. The idea to be discussed was building some kind of student task site.

## Execution

I handled all things brand, marketing, design, and large chunks of the product work. The main focus initially was building a brand.

I started with a logo, a simple set of brand guidelines, and a landing page where people could register their interest.

Below are some of the pieces of work I designed and put together as part of the initial brand and marketing work.

### Product design

Design for this was huge. There were edge cases popping up left right and centre and it was clear we needed to keep the MVP we ship as simple as possible. An MVP prototype was pieced together. You can actually watch an early prototype video:

## Delivery

Delivery was halted because of a letter from the lawyers at upWork who asked us to change the name of our company before we continue to do any more work. We rebranded as Tusk Tasks in early 2019.

## Learning

Take a look at Tusk Tasks for more detail.

* Check, check, and check again for companies with similar names. It seems obvious now that calling a company uWork would be problematic when there's already a company called upWork operating in a similar space. This was back in 2016, and upWork had been around for a year (they didn't IPO until late 2018) and weren't very well known. Looking back at this, it was clearly a huge mistake not to speak up, one I know I will not make again
* This was a project that was done entirely in my spare time and so communication and setting an expectation was key
