## TL:DR;

I led on the GTM for our new product codenamed Seenit Stellar. The project involved all things Product Marketing, from competitive analysis and research, through to landing page design and messaging frameworks. You can still access the waitlist page I designed and built through a [staging site we keep operational.](https://haloed-table.cloudvent.net/stellar/)

## Background

In preparation for the launch of our next generation platform, codenamed Seenit Stellar, I led on the initial Go To Market. The project posed a number of challenges, not least positioning Stellar alongside our platform. Sales and Customer Success enablement was also key to the success, ensuring that the commercial side of the business had the toolkit required.

## Execution

We put together a GTM squad to help with some of the projects that would be required for launch.

### Research

Working closely with a the Product team, two research projects were kicked off. The first to uncover the biggest pain that stellar can solve for our customers, and the second to identify the best target market to launch Stellar marketing efforts towards.

Some of the areas explored included:

* Description of target market
* Size of addressable market
* Growth trends
* Pain points
* Where are the gaps in the market
* Description of competitors

Beginning with a large research project was key to identifying our minimum viable audience and ideal customer profile. The initial view was to sell to anyone that would buy, but after some debate, it was agreed we would focus on identifying and marketing to an MVA.

### Lead generation and nurture

Stellar would be available as an Alpha product around mid 2020 and available for customers to begin migrating around 2021. I wanted to set up a waitlist landing page where we could capture leads that were interested in trying out Stellar. There would be an option to apply to join our early access programme as a beta tester.

Leads that signed up to the waitlist would join a nurture list. We'd send them a regular newsletter with [product updates,](https://www.seenit.io/releases) [case studies,](https://www.seenit.io/case-studies/how-beautystack-gave-their-community-a-voice/) [blogs,](https://www.seenit.io/blog/storytelling/humanise-the-consumer/) and relevant news to keep them excited about Stellar. Leads could 'jump the queue' by sharing Stellar to other users.

### Multi-channel marketing

In the midst of a global pandemic, marketing Stellar was a little different than previously expected. We focused on the following channels for brand awareness, working with a PR and Ad agency to support.

* PPC
* Google Display
* Youtube Ads
* Facebook Ads
* PR
* LinkedIn Ads
* Email Marketing
* Email Outbound
* SEO Content Creation

### Commercial enablement

We worked with CS to set up 'North Star' sessions with all of our subscription customers. These were one-hour long sessions where we could take customers through our 'North Star', a fully designed prototype, of where we wanted Seenit Stellar to be in ~2 years time. The idea of these sessions was to gather feedback and build excitement around a new and exciting product. Customer feedback would help to influence the roadmap, our messaging, and at what point their migration would happen.

## Delivery

The [waitlist](https://haloed-table.cloudvent.net/stellar/) went live in May 2020, alongside the Seenit rebrand. I created a couple of videos alongside the landing page to post across social.

## Results

* 536% increase in MQLs after launch
* 77\.4% increase in website sessions
* 100,000 YouTube views for our What is Seenit video
* The Stellar waitlist was our second most view page 30 days after launch, accounting for 18.39% of traffic
* 11% conversion rate from waitlist sign up to creating an account

## Learning

* I wouldn't have a waiting list again. It doesn't lend itself too well in the B2B SAAS world. We had huge numbers of irrelevant leads come through.
* Gather more information. Leads could sign up to the waiting list with just an email address. As a result we had large numbers of leads we simply knew nothing about. This was pretty useless when analysing trends and looking to refine messaging.
* Review ad performance earlier. As an example, PPC was an extremely successful channel for us on the face of it - the agency we worked with were delighted. Drilling into the data, the conversation rate from waitlist sign up to getting onto the product was extremely poor.
* Set up a dashboard with OKRs and email it to key stakeholders weekly from the start. I didn't do this until a few weeks after launch.
* Segment your sign ups. Identify who could be a 'sneezer' for you early on.
* Focus on delighting a small number of ideal customers early on that can work closely with the product team, rather than trying to get as many customers as possible. Bring in people that can help act as Customer Success Managers for these customers.
* Work more closely with Marketing. I ended up running and managing all of the multi-channel marketing efforts and was stretched pretty thin.
