## **What are cookies?**

Cookies and similar technologies are very small text documents or pieces of code, which often include an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website or use a mobile application, a computer asks your computer or mobile device for permission to store this file on your computer or mobile device and access information from it. Information gathered through cookies and similar technologies may include the date and time of visits and how you are using the particular website or mobile application. Cookies are used by us as part of our services and they are also used by some of our third party partners.

For more details on cookies and similar technologies please visit [All About Cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org). For the purposes of the remaining sections of this Cookie Policy we will refer to all technologies using the above features as “cookies”. &nbsp;

## **Consent to our use of cookies**

You are not obliged to give consent to our use of non-essential cookies.&nbsp;

If you wish to block or delete cookies, or you would like to withdraw consent to our use of non-essential cookies, you can find out how to do so below.&nbsp;

*Essential Cookies*

We use cookies where they are essential for the operation of the services, for example to remember that you are signed in to the services.&nbsp;

*Social Media*

We use cookies to personalise your interaction with social media, such as Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and YouTube.&nbsp; Such cookies recognise users of those social media sites when you view social media content on our services.&nbsp; They also allow you to quickly share content across social media, through the use of simple ‘sharing’ buttons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Our services also contain features that enable you to use your Facebook account to sign in and create/maintain an account with us and to enable us to store your content. This involves the use of cookies.
