It is necessary for the performance and fulfilment of the contract between us to provide you with services for which you have registered.

Sharing your registration data with brand Partners.

Where you join a particular Project, we will share your name and email address with the relevant brand Partner.

Sharing your content with brand Partners

Your right to rectification.

If the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or incomplete, you’re entitled to have it rectified. If we’ve shared your personal information with others, we’ll let them know about the rectification where possible.
