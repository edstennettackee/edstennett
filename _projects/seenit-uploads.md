                <h3>Sketching.</h3>
                <p>Post launch, I carried out a number of user tests to identify potential pain points for users. A common theme for users was not being certain if their upload had completed and where they could see said content. With a trusty whiteboard and pen, I put together the high level information architecture and from there some basic sketches of the user flow. It became apparent that once content has begun to upload, users should see it's progress immediately, as well as being given control over it's state (pause, stop, start).

                <h3>Prototyping.</h3>
                <p>With the IA complete, I worked on a low fidelity prototype for the improved uploads flow. With this, I began some further user tests and iterated the design based on my findings and feedback.

                <p>I used the extensive Seenit iOS and Android Sketch symbol libraries to put together polished designs. I made sure to follow best practice, ensuring the familiar iOS and Android components where used to provide the best possible use experience.
