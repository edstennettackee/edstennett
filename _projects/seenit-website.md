                <h3>First steps.</h3>
                <p>We'd identified as a company a need to update our website. We were using a reasonably clunky, ubiqitious, and buggy wordpress template. We struggled to find the time to prioritise the website among the other projects we had going on. As a result, I took it upon myself to use time off over Christmas to get some mockups together for a new site.

                <h3>Getting started with design.</h3>
                <p>There were a couple of meetings where we fleshed out the basic scope of the project and what we wanted the site to actually do. Using Sketch and Illustrator I produced some mockups and shared the designs with the team. After a couple of rounds of feedback we were ready to begin the build process.</p>

                <h3>Built to scale</h3>
                <p>In order with the site to work for the company we needed to make sure there was a content management system in place so that anyone could go in and add job posts, blogs, or edit pages. We opted for CloudCannon, a Cloud based CMS build specifiaclly for Jekyll. From there, a Jenkins build job was set up so we could have a staging site to test prior to merging into master. Once all of that was set up, it was a case of writing the code and hosting the site through Google Static Pages.</p>
