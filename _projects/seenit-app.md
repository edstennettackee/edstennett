intro: The first major project I worked on with Seenit was the update of the iOS and Android app, Seenit Capture. We used the Double Diamond design process.

                <h3>Pain points.</h3>
                <p>As a product team we began by gathering insights and identifying key pain points for users. Our ultimate objective was to ensure we had more users joining more at least 2 projects and contributing to all available shots. The existing app was designed around users joining a single projects; we wanted to shift users away from this.

                <h3>Defining the focus.</h3>
                <p>Now the pain points had been identified and the initial research carried out, we began to produce some initial low fidelity designs around how we could shift towards a multiple project view. The basic premise was that every part of the app would be global and users could filter by projects they had joined. We conducted several user tests with the low-fi prototype and iterated the design based on feedback and our findings. After several rounds of iterations we were at point where we felt we like we had a enough to move onto the next stage.

                <h3>Building a user interface.</h3>
                <p>As part of the new app we also wanted to update the user interface with a whole new library of components and lighter look and feel. Apple's HIG recommend using one single key colour throughout to indicate interactivity throughout the app. A big focus of mine was to think of Seenit Capture as two different products split between iOS and Android. Throughout the design process, we closely followed HIG and Google's Material documentation, using common components throughout to offer a familiar user experience. I build an iOS and Android symbols library in Sketch to ensure consistency across design. This was added to Zeplin so that the Engineering team would always have a point of reference. When building these components, I also needed to consider how we themed the products for when we needed a white label version of the app. We used a simple, scalable colour theme that allowed us to very quickly and effectively white label Seenit Capture.

                <h3>Launch and next steps.</h3>
                <p>Once the app was ready, we released the app internally for a couple of months to ensure that as a company we were all familiar with the app but also to try to stamp out as many bugs as possible. Once live, we have stuck to fortnightly releases and continue to update and improve the app.
