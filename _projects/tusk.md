                <h3>(Re)designing the brand.</h3>
                <p>After launching uWork, we were forced into a rebrand due to pressure from a company with a similar name, working in a similar market. We had to very quickly get the rebrand up and running so we put our heads together and got to work.</p>

                <h3>uTask, Flock, Acorn...</h3>
                <p>Over the first few weeks, we took a step back inorder to choose a new name that would form the basis of the brand. 100s of names were suggested, some good, some awful, but we finally agreed on Tusk. We liked it as it was similar to Task, but we replaced the 'a' with a 'u' to reference the University students that will be doing the Tasks, plus Narwahls are cool.</p>

                <p>The logomark was designed using a Fibonacci sequence of circles, arranged to create a Narwhal we call 'Nelly'. We used this same principle across our whole brand, using Fibonacci circles laid in a 12 column grid to create a bold, colourful, geometric brand.</p>
