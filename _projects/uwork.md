                <h3>Designing the uWork brand.</h3>
                <p>The first step was to create a strong brand for uWork. I designed a logo and created a set of comprehensive brand guidelines that acted as a starting point for the site itself.</p>

                <p>As a task site aimed at students, the UI and UX for the site and app is critical to uWork's success. Using a combination of Adobe's new XD application and Sketch, a fully designed wireframe was created in addition to a supporting UI kit.</p>
