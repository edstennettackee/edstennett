                <h3>First steps.</h3>
                <p>We wanted to produce two videos. The first would be for social that we could use to highlight the changes and create a buzz about the new app. The second would be used for training purposes when it came to on-boarding new customers and showing them more detail around how to use the app.

                <h3>Animating!</h3>
                <p>I started with a basic storyboard and the general direction I wanted the video to take. I fired up Illustrator, Sketch, and Xcode and began creating the various assets required. Once I had them ready, it was a simple case of animating everything in After Effects and stitching it all together in Premiere Pro.</p>

                <h3>More animating..!</h3>
                <p>I followed a similar process for the 'Using the App Video' as before. The big difference was the inclusion of the voice over which meant get a script nailed early on in the process so that I could animate to the voice. Once we had the voice over done, I tidied it up in Audition and then bought it into After Effects so that I could animate to the voice. I finally brought everything together in Premiere Pro. The video has been a success and is used in Sales and Training decks.</p>
