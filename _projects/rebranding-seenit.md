                <h3>First steps.</h3>
                <p>We started to talk about the visual identity around a year ago. We knew exactly what our mission and vision were, and we wanted our visual identity to reflect this. We started by building out some of our brand messaging and looked at how we could translate this into a visual identity that was clean, simple, and scalable. We wanted to do as much of the rebrand in-house as we could. We’ve got some fiercely talented people at the company and we wanted their skills to be reflected throughout the brand. For additional help, we worked with the amazing Symphony Talent to conduct all of the initial research and help build out our messaging. From there, we brought in Floating Elements who managed to design a new logo that felt fresh, simple and inherently ‘Seenit.’ It was then a case of developing a new design system and a strong, scalable brand identity.
