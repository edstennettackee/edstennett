intro: ackee was a portfolio site for me. It was designed to showcase my recent projects in a simple, yet beautiful way. Rather than use a template or Wordpress theme, I chose to design and hand-code the site from scratch. This gave me complete control and allowed me to apply the unique ackee identity throughout.

                <h3>Early concept.</h3>
                <p>Rather than create an 'Ed Stennett' identity, I wanted to do something different, so I came up with ackee. The brand uses a palette that is simple yet unique with the objective being to create a visual identity that sits in the background and let's the work it's showcasing speak for itself.</p>

                <h3>My first experience with code.</h3>
                <p>This was the first site I have made properly without having to rely on css frameworks like bootstrap or online templates to start me off. The site was hand-coded with aim to be as lightweight as possible. It gave me an opportunity to play around with gulp and npm and the main focus was to keep file sizes down. It was also the first site I've done that uses an ITCSS structure.</p>

                <h3>Animation and UX.</h3>
                <p>Beautiful UI design is big part of everything I do, and even though this is a 'static' site, very subtle parallax effects through out gives a user a desire to scroll through the page. I looked to spend time at the end, fine tuning the details to make it a truly positive user experience.</p>
