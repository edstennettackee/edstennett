                        	I started out at a small Winchester-based agency where I worked for almost four years. I left in mid 2017 as Creative Director. I gained enormous experience across product, design, and technology, helping some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. In the summer of 2017, I moved to London to join a 'Wired Top 100' start-up called Seenit where I work as a Product Marketing Manager. From go-to-market and competitor insights, to brand and marketing design, no two days are the same.

                        	In my spare time, I&rsquo;ve learnt to code mostly with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby, working on a number of professional web projects (and this site!). I&rsquo;ve worked with the static site generator Jekyll, a tool I&rsquo;ve used for all the websites I&rsquo;ve build for clients professionally.
