                        <p class="body-2 editable">I started out in Winchester at a pharmaceutical training agency where I worked for four years. I left in mid 2017 as a technical director. I gained enormous experience in design and technology on global scale, working with some of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. In the summer of 2017 I moved to London to join a wired top 100 start up called Seenit. There, I work as a User Interface Designer across web, iOS and Android. alongside large product, engineering, and research and development teamsâ€™. </p>
                        <p class="body-2 editable">In my spare time, Iâ€™ve learnt to code mostly with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby, working on a number of professional web projects. Iâ€™ve worked with the static site generator Jekyll, a tool Iâ€™ve used for all the websites Iâ€™ve build for clients professionally. Check some of them out.</p>
